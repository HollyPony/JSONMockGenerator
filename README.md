## Installation

- Clone project locally
- Do `npm install` with version of node installed > 6
- Run in debug with `npm run serve` or start a server with `npm start`

## Usage

The idea is to configure the return values in body request. Watether the type and the route.

This way you can test datas with the nearest configuration of the final real webservice.

So this endpoints will be equally interpreted for each `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` methods :
 `localhost:8080`  or `localhost:8080/subfolder/userid?sdf=frl`

Randomized datas are based on ChanceJS lib, litteraly and deeply bades based on.

A value called "date" is a direct call of "chance.date()".
